My slackbuilds repository
=================

Disclaimer
----
This folder contains my personal slackbuilds for my applications and others
third parts applications that I usually install on my local computers.
For now there is no digital signature control and you can not run md5sum yet
for data integrity :-(    
Use at your own risk and danger.

How to use this repository?
----
You probably do not care downloading my slackbuilds repository entirely with `git clone https://github.com/jeanslack/slackbuilds` command, but you want make some package for 
Slackware, and then only downloading a single slackbuild and his content directory. An 
easy way to do this is download it to your local computer with the following command (provided you 
installed the svn package)(replace 'program' with the program name you want):
`svn checkout https://github.com/jeanslack/slackbuilds/trunk/program`

How to do with the slackbuild script?
