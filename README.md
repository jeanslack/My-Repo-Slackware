My-Repo-Slackware
=================

I'm a Slackware lover!

This repository only contains the slackbuilds related to my development projects.

They should be used with their sources in my repository. The source directory must 
be renamed with 'name-version' and compressed in 'tar.gz' archive after the download. 
Put the archive into the slackbuild folder and run 'program.SlackBuild' sh script.

For more information on how to use slackbuilds see:

http://slackbuilds.org/howto/
